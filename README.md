# Bangla_news_classification
# ABSTRACT 
Nowadays, every sector of AI is rapidly advancing and expanding its resources. Bengali is the fifth most widely spoken language globally, but unfortunately, Bengali NLP resources are very limited. Therefore, it's crucial to enhance the dataset and resources for the Bengali language. We created a Bangla news headline dataset with 35,000 headlines so that we can build a model that can detect the political aspect of a headline. We categorized the headlines into three categories: political, international-political, and non-political. This study contributes to the development of digital Bangla newspaper resources.To achieve this goal, with a 35,000-headline dataset, we trained three deep learning models: GRU, LSTM, and BanglaBERT to classify the headlines. The GRU and LSTM models achieved about 88% accuracy, while BanglaBERT (a transformer-based model) achieved 92% accuracy. We worked with a well-structured and sizeable dataset to classify the headlines. This research improves the accuracy of Bangla news classification and increases the Bengali dataset, which will be helpful for newspaper companies.
